Author : Orhan Chavus
Date   : 10.06.2024

This Python program generates a world map using Matplotlib and Cartopy, highlighting cities with scatter points and using hatch patterns to depict landmasses. It's designed to be customizable and suitable for visualizing geographical data.

## Features

- **Map Projection**: Uses Plate Carr√©e projection for a world map view.
- **Cartographic Features**: Includes coastlines and borders.
- **City Markers**: Plots several major cities with customizable markers.
- **Land Hatch Patterns**: Land areas are depicted with randomized hatch patterns.
- **Customization**: Background color, title, and plot layout can be easily adjusted.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Cartopy

## Usage

1. Ensure Python and required libraries are installed (`matplotlib`, `cartopy`).
2. Run the script `app_dots.py`.
3. A PNG file (`world_map_<random_number>.png`) will be generated in the `maps/` directory, depicting the world map with cities.

## Example

```bash
python app_dots.py
```
